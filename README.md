# AR-OT
Tool for connecting an OpenSource IOT project using Firebase, ESP8266 (old i know) and an Augmented Reality using Unity and Scripting with C#
Before using this project, please keep in mind that you need to create an Firebase project, get your API key, user, password, and downloading the api package from firebase and import it to Unity.
Im using Vuforia SDK for the AR, the scripting should be similar. Im only reading the data, not writing directly from my AR (yet)
